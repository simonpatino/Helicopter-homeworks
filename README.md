# Helicopter Dynamics - Assignment 1

## Overview
This repository contains the first assignment for the university course on helicopter fundamentals. The focus of this assignment is to explore and calculate key aspects of induced power in rotor systems, including adjustments for real-world conditions like rotor cut-out and tip losses. The calculations and theoretical explanations are presented in a Jupyter Notebook format.

## Key Objectives
The assignment aims to:
1. Derive the formula for induced power in a rotor system.
2. Analyze the effects of real-world factors such as rotor cut-out and tip losses.
3. Compare ideal and actual power requirements based on specific parameters.

## Calculations and Concepts
The notebook includes:
- Theoretical derivations of the induced power equation:
  \[ P = k \cdot \frac{T^{3/2}}{\sqrt{2 \rho A}} \]
  where:
  - \( P \): Induced power
  - \( k \): Power factor considering rotor losses
  - \( T \): Thrust
  - \( \rho \): Air density
  - \( A \): Rotor area
- Derivation of the effective rotor area (\( A_e \)) accounting for:
  - Blade efficiency \( B \)
  - Cut-out percentage
- Comparison of ideal and actual power outputs.
